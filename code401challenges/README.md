# Challenge Summary
Put an element in the middle of given array.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called `insertShiftArray` which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n)
Becauce there was a single for loop, it would be O(n)

# Challenge Summary
Find the index of the given number in a given array.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called `BinarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n)
Becauce there was a single for while loop, it would be O(n)
