# Reverse an Array
An int of array is given. Reverse the array.

## Challenge
Write a function called ***reverseArray*** which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
If the length of original array is 0 or 1, it will return the original array. If not, it will create a new array. Then loop though the original array and add the element to new array in backward order.
Big O : O(n)
